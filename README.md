## installation
The project assembles by Vite:
```bash
# clone repo or download an archive
git clone https://github.com/YXUNGGG/TicTacToe.git

# install dependencies (sorry i didn't attach them 😭)
npm install

# start dev server
npm run dev

# or run already builded one
npm run preview
```

### Description
**It's just a study project**. The code that's written in this project doesn't pretend to be perfect.
It has some visual bugs, but it works, and you can actually play vs your friend or bot.

Background is very immesrive. Foreground and background mountains with dynamic shadow,
wind currents and kind of changing the time of day (even if it's not exactly in the timing)

Background state storaged in LocalStorage and you can restore your page (CTRL + R or F5)
with logo animation.
### Bots
It's just minimax algorithm implementation and a pinch of randomness that depends on
difficulty of the bot that you choose.

### Special thanks
- *[jsarseny](https://github.com/jsarseny) for providing an example of the implementation of the game engine in js.*
- *Me for not blowing it up (💥💥) this and bringing to some kind of state.*
