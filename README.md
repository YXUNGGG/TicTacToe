### Description
It's just a study project. The code that's written in this project doesn't pretend to be perfect.
It has some visual bugs, but it works, and you can actually play vs your friend or bot.
### Bots
It's just minimax algorithm implementation and A pinch of randomness that depends on
difficulty of the bot that you choose.

### Special thanks
